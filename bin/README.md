# La station de cryptage

Crypter et decrypter le contenu dans un dossier ou un fichier texte.

## Getting Started

When a document is added in the toCrypt folder, a service will automatically crypt the document and send it to the crypted folder.
And a crypted document is added in the toDecypt folder, another service will automatically decrypt the document and send it to the decryoted folder.

### Prerequisites

Clone the git repository onto your computer or download the zip file and extract it.


### Installing

You just need to execute the file install.sh into your terminal and the job is done with the code : ./install.sh

note:*Sometimes you need to give the file executable rights for it to be able to install on your pc, the code to fix that is :chmod +x install.sh*

The code will copy itself into your home ~/src to avoid conflits and issues.

Note: My code run through the path "/home/client/.."- please be sure that your system name is "client" and if not so, just change the path in the code.
